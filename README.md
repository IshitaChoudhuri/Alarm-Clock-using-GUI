# Alarm-Clock-using-GUI
This is a simple alarm clock project with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python and the Tkinter library. The alarm clock allows the user to set a specific time for the alarm when to go off and thereby plays an alarm sound when the time is reached.<br/>



**How to Use:**<br/>
  -Clone the repository to your local machine.
  -Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
  -Install the Tkinter library (if not already installed) by running the following command in your terminal:
    **pip install tk**
  -Run the alarmclock.py file in your Python environment.
  -Set the desired alarm time using the hour, minute, and second(24 hour format) inputs in the GUI.
  -Click the "Start" button to activate the alarm.
  -When the alarm time is reached, a sound is played which can be turned off using the Stop button.
